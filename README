Net_Gearman
About

Net_Gearman is a PEAR package for interfacing with Danga's Gearman. Gearman is a system to farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, or to call functions between languages.

Net_Gearman is currently in production at Yahoo! and Digg doing all sorts of offloaded near time processing.
Installation

   1. Install PEAR if it is not already installed on your system.
   2. Run pear install http://netgearman.googlecode.com/files/Net_Gearman-x.y.z.tgz (Replace x.y.z with the latest version from the featured download to the right).
